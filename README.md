_Significant changes have been noted in the structure and function of the cardiovascular system in
older people that are considered to be the result of aging. These changes can be regarded as either
adaptive or early preclinical disease, but they occur in the absence of clinically manifest dysfunction.
Age-related changes are influenced by the presence of cardiovascular disease; therefore in order to
study the effects of age on the cardiovascular system, individuals without subclinical or overt
disease need to be identified.<br>Given the high prevalence of coronary artery disease in this population, careful screening is required
and invasive tests such as coronary angiography may be necessary_

_Despite the advancement in medicine, management of heart failure, which usually presents as a
disease syndrome, has been a challenge to healthcare providers. This is reflected by the relatively
higher rate of readmissions along with increased mortality and morbidity associated with HF_

_Heart failure is a chronic and progressive clinical syndrome induced by structural or functional
cardiac abnormalities displaying either reduced (in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)) or
preserved (in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)1.
Cardiac dysfunction leads to elevated cardiac filling pressures at rest and during stress. HF
symptoms include dyspnoea (shortness of breath) and fatigue, often accompanied by typical physical
signs, such as pulmonary rales (abnormal crackling sounds), peripheral oedema or distended jugular
veins._

_Heart failure is not a single pathological diagnosis, but a clinical syndrome consisting of cardinal
symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) that may be accompanied by signs (e.g.
elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral oedema). It is due to a
structural and/or functional abnormality of the heart that results in elevated intracardiac pressures
and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise._

# For Solving this Usecase, What I have done is :
- Collected the data and organized it to form a meaningful dataset.
- Checked for null values and took care of it.
- Observed the data to form meaningful insights!
<br><br>
- Did Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
- Used correlations to form a heatmap!!

# For Visualizations, i used :
- Visualizations were made by using Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries..!!

# Did Data Pre-Processing and Feature Engineering :
- Made dummies for improving my model's Performance.
- One-hot-Encoding was Implemented.
- Made Binary Classifications Using Label Encoder and Standard Scaler
<br> To fit and transform Numerical and Categorical Column values.


# And then I made my model for the Prediction :
- Did data processing
- Independent and Dependent Features.
- Did Train-Test split

# Trained my Model using :
- _Logistic Regresson_
- _Random Forest Classifier_
- _Support Vector Machine_
- _Ada Boost Classifier_

# _Logistic Regression_

- Predicted for the data
- Finded Accuracy score
- Plotted Confusion Matrix
- And at last, Classification report.


# _Random Forest Classifier_

- Predicted for the data
- Finded Accuracy score
- Plotted Confusion Matrix
- And at last, Classification report.
- And Analyzed the key factors responsible for prediction.


# _Support Vector Machine_

- Predicted for the data
- Finded Accuracy score
- Plotted Confusion Matrix
- And at last, Classification report.


# _Ada boost Classifier_

- Predicted for the data
- Finded Accuracy score
- Plotted Confusion Matrix
- And at last, Classification report.

# _And Now, `Speeding towards the conclusion` -_

#### _From the above Four trained Models, It can be seen that <br> With the `Accuracy of around 86.41%`, <br> the Support Vector Machine Model performed slightly better than rest of the Models._
